                        Acclaimed as a five-star art sanctuary, Elegence is a serene paradise under the dancing shadows of the renowned sunset. 
                        Just steps away from the traditional art and fashion market of Bali street, the resort is a sanctuary at one with nature. 
                        Spaciously set within a romantic 6.8-hectare garden landscape, 
                        the resort provides comfortable accommodation, 
                        world-class facilities and the celebrated Balinese hospitality that promise wonderful stays for discerning travelers.
